Keypads
  - stateless: (optional) determines if these are  2 way buttons that will also trigger a lutron button press (false) or listen only buttons that will trigger a HomeKit action (true), default: false
  - buttons: (required) array group defining the buttons on the keypad exposed to HomeKit

Each button in the array has
  - id: (required) component number of that button (e.g. button 1 on the keypad has id `1`)
  - name: (optional) engraving name
  - led: (required) the integration ID of that button used for statusing
